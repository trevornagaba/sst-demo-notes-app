// Configure AWS Amplify

// 1. Amplify refers to Cognito as Auth, S3 as Storage, and API Gateway as API.
// 2. The mandatorySignIn flag for Auth is set to true because we want our users to be signed in 
//    before they can interact with our app.
// 3. The name: "notes" is basically telling Amplify that we want to name our API. 
//    Amplify allows you to add multiple APIs that your app is going to work with. 
//    In our case our entire backend is just one single API.
// 4. The Amplify.configure() is just setting the various AWS resources that we want to interact with. 
//    It isnâ€™t doing anything else special here beside configuration. 
//    So while this might look intimidating, just remember this is only setting things up.
